### 👋 Welcome to Leigh-Services

We are a group of solutions-focused automation engineers, PowerShell developers, and infrastructure professionals, collaborating on tools that help bridge the gap between operations and development.

Founded by [Luke Leigh](https://github.com/BanterBoy), Leigh-Services is built on over 25 years of hands-on experience with enterprise IT environments, security compliance (including PCI-DSS), and the ever-changing landscape of cloud infrastructure and automation tooling.

If it plugs in, pings, or prints logs — chances are, we’ve scripted it. 💻⚡

### 🚀 Our Mission

To build, maintain, and share professional-grade PowerShell modules and scripts that empower infrastructure teams to automate securely, scale confidently, and sleep occasionally.
